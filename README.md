# Calculator

The aim of this project was to implement a working calculator which allowed for the following basic operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

A user can also clear the current memory and output using the clear 
button.

It must be noticed that decimal truncation occurs when the number of 
digits exceeds 13.
